# iot-hub
# About
IoT Hub as a Service (HaaS), a framework that enables data-oriented interoperability and provides an environment for IoT application development. Made as part of the research paper at Northeastern Illinois University.
# The Project Directory

Created five packages and created some classes and interfaces inside these packages, as seen in the below  image:

* annotation: get current ElementType of specific annotation
* controller: The most important part is the controller layer. It binds everything together right 
             from the moment a request is intercepted till the response is prepared and sent back, 
             A RESTful Controller where we expose the applicationâ€™s data to a client.
             We will make use of several HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE to support features associated with them.
* model: The various models of the application are organized under the model package,
            Defines a collection of state variables, as well as the functionality for working with these variables.
* repository: An interface available in Spring Boot named as CrudRepository that contains
            methods for CRUD operations. It provides generic Crud operation on a repository.
            CRUD stands for Create, Read/Retrieve,Update and Deleteand these are the four basic operations that we perform on persistence storage.
* service: A package that implements the ProductService interface with @Service annotation writes
            the business logic to store, retrieve, delete, and update the product.

## Synchronous Applications

keywords : TH, DT, VS

### Scope

/TH:*/                      --> all things

/TH:132f1fa/          --> sepcific thing

/TH:1234ff,87965/           --> list of things

/DT:*/                      --> all data item

/DT:89ghuuuiihf/           -->  perticular data item by Id

/VS:vsp12345/TH:*/         -->  all things in specified VS

/VS:vsp12345/TH:gt6788900/ --> perticular thing in specified VS

/VS:vsp12345/DT:*/         --> all dataItems in specified VS

/VS:vsp12345/DT:gt678hh00/ --> perticular thing in specified VS
